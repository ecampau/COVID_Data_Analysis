# COVID_Data_Analysis
I created this project as a part of the Girls Who Code Leadership Academy in Fall 2023. The goal is to analyze, visualize, and interpret COVID-19 data and present it in a way that the average viewer can understand. To accomplish this, I summarized my findings on this website: https://emc-covid19analysis.weebly.com/

The data used in the project was downloaded from the CDC.
